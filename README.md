IpyDisp: An Advanced Software for Simulating Insect Dynamics Across Time and Space. 
Utilizing cellular automata principles, IpyDisp offers an in-depth exploration of insect movements across both time and space. 
Within this framework, each cell can adopt one of three states: unoccupied, colonized, or exposed. 
Operating within a 2D grid, each cell engages with its eight surrounding neighbourhood. 
Transition patterns, which illustrate insect dispersal, depend on a cell's current state and its neighbors' conditions.
A unique algorithm evaluates the likelihood of insects settling in a specific cell, 
taking into account constraints (factors such as available food, suitable habitats, and favorable environmental conditions).
